  <h1>Donate</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left;">I created a "Donate" page in case a visitor is both <strong>rich enough</strong> and <strong>stupid enough</strong> to send me free money.</p>

<h3><strong>NOTE:</strong></h3>
<h5>
  I am not broke by any means.<br />
  I'm just a mid-twenties manchild who lives with his parents and hopes to make it someday.<br />
  If I lose my entire portfolio, I will still have a roof over my head.<br />
  Additionally, this website has no hosting costs and the domain cost me less than $20.<br />
  <br />
  There are thousands of more noble places for you to send your money.<br />
  That being said, if you <strong>do</strong> give me any tokens, I promise to hold onto them for years to come.
