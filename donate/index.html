  <h1>Donate</h1>
  <p><strong>I decided to create a "Donate" page in case a visitor is both rich enough and stupid enough to send me free money</strong></p>

<h5><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am not broke by any means. I'm a mid-twenties manchild who lives with his parents and hopes to make it someday. If I lose my entire portfolio, I will still have a roof over my head. Additionally, this website has no hosting costs and the domain cost me less than $20. There are thousands of more noble places for you to send your money. That being said, if you <strong>do</strong> give me any tokens, I promise to hold onto them for years to come.</h5>
